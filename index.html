<h1>Mapping the Crisis: A Spatial Analysis of Homeless Shelters in Manhattan and the Bronx</h1>

<section> 
    <h2> Research Questions:<br>
        Are there clusters of homeless shelters in New York City? Do these clusters have similar demographics, and how do they differ from other neighborhoods without shelters?
        Do people living in these shelters have adequate access to life-saving facilities? Where should shelters be located so that those using them have adequate access?
        </h2>
    <p> Manhattan is the location of interest because of its glaring wealth gaps, while the Bronx is because of its dense Black and Brown populations and lower median household income.
